Thank you for considering contributing to our library! We welcome any and all contributions, whether it be bug fixes, new features, or documentation improvements.

## Getting Started
To get started contributing, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running npm install.
3. Create a new branch for your changes with a descriptive name, e.g. fix-bug-123.
4. Make your changes and test them thoroughly.
5. Run npm run lint and npm run test to ensure your changes pass our linting and testing standards.
6. Commit your changes using conventional commits. Make sure your commit messages are descriptive and follow the format specified in our commit guidelines.
7. Push your changes to your fork and create a pull request to the main branch of this repository.

## Commit Guidelines
We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to ensure consistent and informative commit messages. Please follow these guidelines when making commits:

- Use the present tense ("add feature" instead of "added feature").
- Use imperative mood ("fix bug" instead of "fixed bug").
- Use a type prefix in your commit message to indicate the type of change you are making. For example, `feat` for a new feature, `fix` for a bug fix, `docs` for documentation changes, and so on.
- Separate the type prefix from the rest of your commit message with a colon and a space. For example, feat: add new function.
- Use the body of your commit message to provide more detail about your changes if necessary.

## Code Style
We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to enforce a consistent code style. Please run npm run lint before making a commit to ensure your code passes our linting standards.

## Testing
We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. Please write tests for any new features or bug fixes you add, and ensure all existing tests pass before making a commit. You can run the tests with npm run test.

## Documentation
We welcome improvements to our documentation! If you see something that could be clarified or improved, please submit a pull request with your changes.
